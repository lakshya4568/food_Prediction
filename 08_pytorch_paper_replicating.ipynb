However, setting `pin_memory=True` doesn't *always* improve performance (this is another one of those we're scenarios in machine learning where some things work sometimes and don't other times), so best to *experiment, experiment, experiment*.

        "* Pretrained models are available for many state of the art model architectures and with the power of transfer learning, these often perform *very* well with little data.\n",
