## 🔍 Overview

NutriVision is an AI-powered application that uses computer vision and machine learning to identify food from photos and provide detailed nutritional information. The system combines a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for food classification with Google's Gemini API for personalized health recommendations based on user profiles.

This application aims to simplify nutrition tracking and promote healthier eating habits by making nutritional information instantly accessible through a simple photo.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

NutriVision utilizes two primary AI components:

### 1. Vision Transformer (ViT) Food Classification Model

- **Architecture**: ViT-B/16 (Vision Transformer Base with 16×16 patch size)
- **Pre-training**: Initially trained on ImageNet, fine-tuned for food classification
- **Classes**: Currently supports pizza, steak, and sushi classification
- **Performance**: High accuracy in food identification from various angles and lighting conditions
- **Implementation**: PyTorch-based with torchvision integration

### 2. Google Gemini AI for Nutritional Analysis

- **Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Purpose**: Analyzes identified foods and provides health recommendations
- **Personalization**: Takes into account user's health metrics (height, weight, BMI)
- **Output**: Structured JSON with health benefits and personalized recommendations

---

## 🔌 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Parameters | Response |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------|----------|
| `/predict` | POST | Identifies food from an image | `image`: file | JSON with food class and confidence scores |
| `/get_health_info` | POST | Provides nutritional analysis | `food_name`, `height`, `weight`, `bmi`, `conditions` | JSON with health benefits and recommendations |
| `/health` | GET | API health check | None | Status indicator |

---

## 📥 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- A Google Gemini API key

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food_Prediction.git
   cd food_Prediction
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Gemini API**
   - Set your Gemini API key in app.py

   ```python
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
   ```

5. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   - The app will be available at: `http://localhost:5000`
   - An ngrok public URL will be displayed in the console

## 🚀 Usage

### Food Recognition

1. Take or upload a photo of food
2. The system identifies the food item
3. View confidence scores for the prediction

### Nutritional Analysis

1. After food recognition, submit your health profile
2. Receive personalized nutritional information
3. Get recommendations based on your health metrics

### API Integration

```python
# Example: Food Recognition API Call
import requests

url = "http://localhost:5000/predict"
files = {"image": open("food.jpg", "rb")}
response = requests.post(url, files=files)
prediction = response.json()
```

---

## 🔗 Frontend Integration

The NutriVision backend API can be integrated with various frontend frameworks. A sample HTML/CSS/JS implementation is provided in the nutri-vision-mainpage directory.

For a complete user experience, the frontend should:

1. Provide image upload/capture functionality
2. Collect user health metrics
3. Display food recognition results
4. Present nutritional information and recommendations

---

## 🔮 Development Roadmap

- [ ] **Expand food classification**: Increase the number of recognizable food items
- [ ] **Portion size estimation**: Add capability to estimate serving sizes
- [ ] **Meal composition analysis**: Identify multiple foods in a single image
- [ ] **User accounts**: Add user authentication and history tracking
- [ ] **Mobile application**: Develop dedicated iOS and Android apps
- [ ] **Offline capability**: Enable functionality without internet connection
- [ ] **Multi-language support**: Add internationalization

## � Authentication (JWT)

The project now includes a Node/Express authentication backend (see `server.js`) with secure password hashing (bcrypt) and stateless JWT session cookies.

### Key Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Create a user account (firstName, lastName, email, password) |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticate user (email, password); sets `auth_token` httpOnly cookie |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | Clears auth cookie |
| GET | `/api/me` | Returns current authenticated user |
| GET/PUT | `/api/profile` | Get / update health profile for current user |

### Environment Variables

Add / update these in `.env` (do NOT commit real secrets):

```
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=nutrivision
POSTGRES_USER=youruser
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword
JWT_SECRET=REPLACE_WITH_STRONG_RANDOM_64BYTE_HEX
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
```

Generate a strong secret:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 64
```

### Frontend Integration

The Next.js app uses an `AuthProvider` (`src/components/AuthContext.jsx`) which:
- Automatically calls `/api/me` on load
- Exposes `login(email, password)`, `register(data)`, `logout()`
- Stores user object in context

Protected application pages under `src/app/(main)` are wrapped with `RequireAuth` which redirects unauthenticated users to `/login?redirect=...`.

### Login / Registration UI

`/login` page now submits to backend endpoints. After success it redirects to the `redirect` query param or `/dashboard`.

### Logout

Logout button in the header calls `/api/auth/logout` and clears context.

### Testing Auth Flow

Run a scripted end-to-end flow (server must be running on port 3001):

```bash
npm run test:auth
```

This script registers a random user, logs in, calls `/api/me`, logs out, and asserts that access is revoked.

### Database

Tables (`users`, `health_profiles`, `meals`) are created via:

```bash
npm run db:setup
```

Passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes (`password_hash`). Tokens use `auth_token` httpOnly cookie (7 day default lifespan).

### Security Notes

* Always use a long random `JWT_SECRET` in production.
- Set `NODE_ENV=production` to enforce `secure` cookies behind HTTPS.
- Consider adding rate limiting and email verification for production deployments.
