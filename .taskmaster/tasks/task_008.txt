# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Medical Document Uploader and Parser
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Allow users to upload medical documents, perform client-side OCR, and use Gemini to extract structured data.
# Details:
On the `health-docs` page, use Tesseract.js for client-side OCR on uploaded PDF/PNG files. Send the extracted text to a Node.js endpoint `/api/upload-doc`, which then calls the Gemini API for parsing. Store the resulting JSON in the user's profile and display it.

# Test Strategy:
Upload a sample medical document (e.g., a lab result PDF). Verify that the OCR text is generated and that the `health-docs` page displays structured data (e.g., diagnoses, medications) returned from the backend.
