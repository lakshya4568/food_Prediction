# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Health Rating System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement a backend service to calculate a health rating (A-E) for meals based on their nutritional data and the user's health profile.
# Details:
Create a Node.js endpoint `/api/rating` that accepts nutritional data and a user ID. The logic should score the food against the user's goals (from their profile) and return a grade. Display this grade as a colored badge in the UI.

# Test Strategy:
Call the `/api/rating` endpoint with sample meal data for two different user profiles (e.g., one with a low-sodium goal). Verify the returned rating is different and appropriate for each profile.
