# Task ID: 3
# Title: Setup Node.js Backend & Postgres Database
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Initialize a new Node.js/Express server to handle non-ML backend logic and connect it to a local Postgres database with the required schema.
# Details:
Create a `server.js` file for the Express app. Establish a connection to a local Postgres instance (e.g., `postgresql://localhost/nutrivision`). Define and create the `users` and `meals` tables as specified in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Start the Node.js server and confirm it connects to the database without errors. Use a database client to verify that the `users` and `meals` tables have been created with the correct columns.
