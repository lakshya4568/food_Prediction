# Task ID: 2
# Title: Build Modern UI Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop reusable UI components like cards, buttons, and a file upload zone using Tailwind CSS to establish the application's visual style.
# Details:
Style components with Tailwind utility classes, including gradients (e.g., `bg-gradient-to-r`), shadows, and transitions. Implement a drag-and-drop file upload zone with visual feedback and a progress bar.

# Test Strategy:
Create a test page or use Storybook to render and visually inspect all components. Verify hover effects and that the file upload zone responds to drag events.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Reusable Button Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a primary, reusable button component styled with Tailwind CSS, including all interactive states.
### Details:
Implement the button using Tailwind utility classes. It must feature a gradient background (`bg-gradient-to-r`), a subtle shadow, and smooth transitions for `hover` and `active` states. Ensure a disabled state is also styled.

## 2. Build a Versatile Card Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Construct a reusable card component for displaying content, styled with modern aesthetics using Tailwind CSS.
### Details:
Design a flexible card layout with rounded corners, shadows, and appropriate padding. The structure should be generic enough to hold various content types, such as text, lists, or other components.
<info added on 2025-08-05T14:42:45.192Z>
Implementation Details:
- Created Card.jsx in src/components/ui/ folder
- Built a modular card system with multiple sub-components
- Used forwardRef for proper ref handling across all components

Main Card Component Features:
- Multiple variants: default, elevated, outlined, glass
- Configurable padding: none, sm, md, lg, xl
- Shadow options: none, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl
- Rounded corner options: none, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl
- Optional hover effects with scaling animation
- Optional border styling
- Gradient background option
- Dark mode support
- Flexible content container

Sub-Components:
- CardHeader - For card titles and headers with bottom border
- CardTitle - Configurable heading sizes (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
- CardContent - Styled content area with proper text styling
- CardFooter - Footer area with top border and flex layout

Design Features:
- Rounded corners with multiple size options
- Modern shadow system with hover effects
- Responsive and flexible layout
- Dark mode compatibility
- Smooth transitions for all interactive states
- Generic structure to hold various content types
- Clean, modern aesthetic with proper spacing

## 3. Implement Drag-and-Drop Zone UI and Event Handling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the UI for the file upload zone and implement the client-side logic to handle drag-and-drop events with visual feedback.
### Details:
Build the drop zone layout with instructive text. Use JavaScript to listen for `dragenter`, `dragleave`, and `drop` events. Apply conditional Tailwind classes to change the border style or background color when a file is dragged over the area.

## 4. Develop File Upload Progress Bar [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a dynamic progress bar component to provide visual feedback during a file upload.
### Details:
Style a progress bar component using Tailwind CSS. It should consist of an outer container and an inner bar whose width is controlled by a prop (e.g., a percentage value). This component will be placed within the file upload zone.
<info added on 2025-08-05T14:46:10.084Z>
- Created `ProgressBar.jsx` in `src/components/ui/` and added a shimmer animation to `tailwind.config.js`.
- The implementation consists of two distinct components:
  - **ProgressBar (General):** A highly configurable base component supporting multiple sizes (sm, md, lg, xl), variants (primary, success, warning, danger), gradient backgrounds, an optional shimmer effect, and an indeterminate mode for unknown progress.
  - **FileUploadProgress (Specialized):** Builds upon the base component to provide a complete file upload UI. It includes file name and size display, upload speed calculation, time remaining estimation, status management (uploading, completed, error, paused) with corresponding icons, and a cancel button.
- Technical features include proper progress normalization, file size/time formatting utilities, dynamic styling based on status, dark mode support, and accessibility considerations.

## 5. Assemble and Test Components on a Showcase Page [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Integrate all created UI components onto a single showcase page or Storybook to verify their appearance and functionality together.
### Details:
Create a new page/route to display the button, card, and the complete file upload zone (including the progress bar). This page will serve as the final visual review and testing ground for the components.
