# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Micro-Interactions & Accessibility
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance user experience with animations for loading states and feedback, while ensuring basic accessibility standards are met.
# Details:
Use Tailwind's `animate-pulse` for loading skeletons during data fetches. Implement toast notifications for success/error messages. Add ARIA attributes to interactive elements like forms and buttons. Ensure logical tab navigation.

# Test Strategy:
Trigger a data fetch and verify a loading animation appears. Test that form submissions show a success/error toast. Use a keyboard to navigate through a page and ensure all interactive elements are focusable in a logical order.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Loading Skeleton Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement loading skeleton components using Tailwind's animate-pulse for data fetch loading states
### Details:
Create reusable skeleton components for different content types (cards, lists, text blocks) using Tailwind CSS animate-pulse. These will be displayed during data loading states to provide visual feedback to users.

## 2. Implement Toast Notification System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a comprehensive toast notification system for displaying success/error/info messages to users
### Details:
Create a toast notification component with different variants (success, error, warning, info) that can display temporary messages. Include animations for slide-in/slide-out effects and auto-dismiss functionality. Implement a toast provider/context for managing multiple toasts.

## 3. Enhance Accessibility with ARIA Attributes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add comprehensive ARIA attributes and semantic HTML to improve accessibility for screen readers and assistive technologies
### Details:
Audit existing components and pages to add proper ARIA labels, roles, and descriptions. Ensure forms have proper labels and error messaging. Add focus management and screen reader friendly content. Verify semantic HTML structure and landmark regions.

## 4. Implement Keyboard Navigation & Focus Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement logical keyboard navigation and focus management throughout the application
### Details:
Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible with proper tab order. Implement focus trapping in modals/dropdowns. Add visible focus indicators and skip navigation links. Test and verify logical tab navigation flow across all pages and components.
